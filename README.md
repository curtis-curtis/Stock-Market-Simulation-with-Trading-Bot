# Stock-Market-Simulation-with-Trading-Bot
This was an assignment in COMP2012, designed by Chenyue Li and Assem Zhunis. It involves simulating stock prices using Geometric Brownian Motion and evaluating the performance of technical analysis strategies, including the Mean Reversion Strategy, Trend Following Strategy, and Weighted Trend Following Strategy.

Mean Reversion Strategy:    
Buys stocks when the price falls below the moving average minus a specific threshold, and sells when it exceeds the moving average plus the threshold.

Trend Following Strategy:  
Buys stocks when the short-term average exceeds the long-term average, and sells when it falls below.

Weighted Trend Following Strategy:  
Like the Trend Following Strategy, but gives greater weight to more recent data in calculating moving average.
